# HSK-3.0
wxPython GUI for HSK 3.0 characters and vocab practice. Audio is generated from gTTS using the Zhuyin <sup>I believe it sounds fine</sup>. It also uses pygame for to play said audio.

Dependencies:
<pre> pip install wxpython pygame </pre>

To run:
<pre> python main.py </pre>

It is a little messy - it is functional though lol. Need to finish the rest of the csv files and generate audio for them - future Steven problem. For now only the band1_char.csv works.
